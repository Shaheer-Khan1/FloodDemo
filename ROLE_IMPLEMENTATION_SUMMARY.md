## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Access Control Layers

**1. Route Protection**
```typescript
// Protected route checks:
- Is user authenticated?
- Does user have profile?
- Is user admin OR has role?
- Redirect to role-selection if no role
```

**2. Page-Level Protection**
```typescript
// Each page checks:
- User role matches required permission
- Show access denied if unauthorized
- Redirect to appropriate page
```

**3. Component-Level Protection**
```typescript
// UI elements check:
- Hide buttons user can't access
- Disable unavailable actions
- Show/hide based on role
```

**4. Firestore Rules**
```javascript
// Backend enforcement:
- Validate user role
- Check permissions
- Deny unauthorized access
```
