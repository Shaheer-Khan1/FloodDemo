## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Firebase
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Firestore, Storage, and Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Copy your Firebase config
4. Create a `.env` file in project root:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Step 3: Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and sign up!

**Important:** 
- Regular users will see a role selection screen after signup
- To make yourself an admin: Firebase Console → Firestore → users collection → your user document → set `isAdmin: true`
- Admins bypass role selection and get full access
